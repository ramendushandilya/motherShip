Hi,

Regarding the concern for correctness of the test cases executed by me, I shall like to know the test cases where I did it wrong. 
As per communicated by the "team member name here" it was was said that 60% of the TCs were wrong, since that's a huge a number, 
I don't want to repeat the mistakes, so kindly tell me the ways in which the same could be improved. 
I don't want the team velocity to plummet due to some falt at my end. Also, having said all these things I shall continue working 
my part as per the best of my knowledge and skill. Since I haven't gotten any clarity on the claim of faulty TCs I think it shall 
be a wise decision to let me know the details of the wrong doings. Also, since I know that 60% is a big claim, hence it's natural 
for me to expect the details related to this, I urge the team to take this request in good spirits.
